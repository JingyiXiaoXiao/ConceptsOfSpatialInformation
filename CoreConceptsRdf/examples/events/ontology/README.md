Core Concepts of Spatial Information - Ontology use cases
==========================================================

Abstract: Use cases and SPARQL queries for the RDF schema and owl ontologies located in the CoreConceptsRdf main folder.

The RDF file (`owl_ontology.rdf`) contains use cases for the ontologies (`event_ttl.owl`) and (`event_rdfs.owl`) located in the folder (`CoreConceptsRdf`).
The RDF file (`owl_ontology_2.rdf`) contains use cases for the ontology (`event_xml_2.owl`) located in the folder (`CoreConceptsRdf`).
The RDF file (`rdfs_ontology.rdf) contains use cases for the RDF schema (`event_rdfs.rdf`) located in the folder (`CoreConceptsRdf`).
