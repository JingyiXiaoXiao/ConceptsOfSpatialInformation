Core Concepts of Spatial Information - Python (ArcPy)
=============================================

Abstract: A Python implementation of the core concepts leveraging ArcPy processing.

The implementation is divided into abstract definitions (`coreconcepts.py`),
implementation of one core concept per file (`objects.py` and `fields.py`)

See the [Readme](../../README.md) in the parent directory for general information about the Core Concepts.

Right now the implementation is in a proof of concept state and should not be considered stable for a production environment.
