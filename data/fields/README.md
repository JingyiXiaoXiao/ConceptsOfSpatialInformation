Core Concepts of Spatial Information - Fields Data
----------------------
testField.tif - a 50x50 pixel subset of the CalPolyDEM.tif GeoTiff described below
zone.tif - a binary zone raster with the same extent as testField. A value of 1 represents elevation greater than or equal to 118 m.
CalPolyDEM.tif - a Digital Elevation Model of the CalPoly campus (see details below).

GeoTiff used for PV site-suitability analysis for the CalPoly San Luis Obispo campus. Acquired from OpenTopography, January 2014.

The file included here is first-return LiDAR data ("highest hit").
